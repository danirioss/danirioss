Hey people ðŸ‘‹

Let me resume a bit of myself:
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on improving both projects I've released at Le Wagon: Rethink Your Trahs and Take My Book
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to be a mom and code at the same time
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything! So open to code and learn
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Ruby On Rails - I might be able to help you with something
- ðŸ“« Reach me on my email: danirioscampelo@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I never thought I would be coding until I did it the 1st time and got addicted
